The gaol of the game is to checkmate the opponemt

The elemets of the game: 
- 2 Players ( Have a name and color)

- Board ( has a grid structure, with rows and columns)

- Pieces (move, have a position, have color(BLACK/WIHTE) ) 6 different kinds ( rook, bishop, pawn, king, queen, knight)
  each kind moves differently ( different directions )

I need to creae a tree of possible moves: 
  - The king has special conditions becuase of the checkmate
  - bts of the moves, if there isn't none that means that is an invalid move

  PAWN
  - Switch with another piece when reached the end Board  
  
  ROOK
  - It can move inline, 4 possible directions

  BISHOP
  - allowed moves, 

  QUEEN 
  - #allowed_move, can move like a bishop and a rook, I moved the movement logic the the superclass Pice
   this way teh code i more readable and more dry, i feel like i can improve the design, it will be great if
   i could get rid off the dependecie of board

  KNIGHT
  - The knight has his unique way of moving on the board, so i will just ceate a method directly in the Knight class
    * write the integration test, for testing the possibele moves

  Game flow: 
  - Whites start first
  - whites chose a piece 
    if is a valid pice ( has_moves?, white? )
      get_piece
    else
      chose another piece
  - chose_new_position
    if its a valid position ( allowed_move? ) 
      set new position
    else
      choose another position
  - check if is a check or a checkmate ( game_over? )
    if yes
      ends game, white wins 
    else
  - Black turn 
  - chose_piece
    if is a valid pice ( has_moves?, white? )
      get_piece
    else
      chose another piece
  - chose_new_position
    if its a valid position ( allowed_move? ) 
      set new position
    else
      choose another position
  - check if is a check or a checkmate ( game_over? )
    if yes
      ends game, black wins 
    else
    Repeat again
      


Issues
  - If the pawn has an opponemt in front of him it can be choosen 
  - When an opponent take another pawn and puts the opponent in check, the taker dissapears 
  - if a move a pawn one tail at the beginning the i cannot do more moves
