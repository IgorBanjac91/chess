The gaol of the game is to checkmate the opponemt

The elemets of the game: 
- 2 Players ( Have a name and color)

- Board ( has a grid structure, with rows and columns)

- Pieces (move, have a position, have color(BLACK/WIHTE) ) 6 different kinds ( rook, bishop, pawn, king, queen, knight)
  each kind moves differently ( different directions )

 I need to creae a tree of possible moves: 
  - The king has special conditions becuase of the checkmate
  - bts of the moves, if there isn't none that means that is an invalid move

  PAWN
  - Switch with another piece when reached the end Board  
  
  ROOK
  - It can move inline, 4 possible directions
