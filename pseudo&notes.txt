I'm trying to aporach this game wiht a BDD way

What is the main thing that my game does?
I have some difficulty this way, maybe I don't have enough experience with this kind testing 
I'll try to approach this problem form the inside out

The gaol of the game is to checkmate the opponemt

The elemets of the game: 
- 2 Players ( Have a name and color)

- Board ( has a grid structure, with rows and columns)

- Pieces (move, have a position, have color(BLACK/WIHTE) ) 6 different kinds ( rook, bishop, pawn, king, queen, knight)
  each kind moves differently ( different directions )

I need to see if the path that a piece should take is valid, for example: along the path is there any other piece
the pawn can move diagonally only for eating another piece

 I need to creae a tree of possible moves: 
  - The king has special conditions becuase of the checkmate
  - bts of the moves, if there isn't none that means that is an invalid move
